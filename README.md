# ASCII Pokemon

## About
This was a fun project for my advanced programming techniques class in college using the languages C and C++.
Disclosure: All code in final project is not my own as it was a semester project and operated by checkpoints.
However, all features and data structures were implemented by me throughout the project.

## Running the source code.
I used VSCode and minGW to run this project on Windows. 
It was originally ran on unix but for convienience I changed it to run on windows. 

Step 1: Download MinGW (A native Windows port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)). https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
  You need this because you will need to install the following libraries from it to run the program on Windows.
    - libstdc++-6.dll provides the standard C++ library implementations such as containers, algorithms, and utilities.
    - libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll exception handling and other runtime functionalities.
    - libncursesw-6.dll which is used for creating text-based user interfaces in terminal applications.

Step 2: In vscode, 
  - open the "ascii-pokemon" folder.
  - then open a terminal and `cd smith_jacob.assignment-1.10`
  - `make`
  - `.\pokemon.exe` which will run the file you made.

Step 3:
