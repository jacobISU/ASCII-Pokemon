# How To Play

> **Important:** The game is not complete and only utilizes elements of pokemon due to the reason it was created.
> It was an excercise to become better at prgramming, not specifically game development.
> If you play this to actually "Catch them all" or "Be the very best", you will be greatly disappointed.
